    <p> <b> • Facts: </b> I like IT programming, and study front end back end.

    <p> <b> • IT interest: </b> My brother is the one who inspired me to follow the IT patch. I said that because anytime I saw him on the computer, his fingers  surfed on the keyboard so fast that I couldn't even recognize what he was trying to type. Each line of code he types on the computer makes me wonder what he is going to create with those lines. Suddenly, he shows me that if any spam email or malware wants to enter our PC system, it will immediately remove the harmful material. From that moment, I feel that IT will be my future career where I could develop software that protects others' private information against those hackers who try to steal bank accounts, and customer data. Moreover, I have participated in a robotics coding competition 2 years ago which my team earned second place overall. This powerful experience I gained was really helpful with the major I currently study in Rmit. I have taken one more step closer to become a skillful software developer. Although I still need to put more effort into it, I will try my best.

The previous job idea I chose was IOS developers. There are two main groups of skills of my ideal jobs are general skills and IT-specific skills.
On the one hand, general skills in IOS developer needed key requirements such as good communication skills in English and working experience in iOS development.
On the other hand, IT-specific skills in IOS developer requirements such as working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, architectures, trends, and emerging technologies. As for the required programming languages, there are Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.

<p> The requirement of the iOS developer recruiter is to have experience with working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, emerging architecture, trends and technologies. Besides, the requirement for minimum languages to do it on the iOS platform is Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.

<p> Based on the Burning Glass Data table from May, 2017 to March 2018, there are 3 highest ranked programming languages based on Australian statistics: SQL, Java Script and Microsoft Windows. All three languages above are not included in the job requirements I selected.

</font> </li>
<p> After looked at the burning glass data, I decided to change my idea job because based on the statistics from May 2017 to March 2018, all the language required of the idea job I was selections are not at the top of the selected language. Although communication skills make up the highest percentage of general skills, I find that it can only really work if my required language has the same level of influence. In addition, learning a language for the IOS platform is a unique request of the employers so it is possible to limit the ability to work in the future.

<p> My ideal job is to become software engineering, and I also love coding. Moreover, my job requirement does need two main skills such as software development as well as programming in order to become a successful software engineer. In software engineering it requires us to have knowledge on C++, Python, and anything that relates to programming. The more you learn the easier it is to complete the task and perform well in every situation.

  As I research on the active selection, Java is ranked in the 3rd position and it is the most foremost skill needed. Besides that, the GIT skill seems not to be as important as the Java. However, it is still required in order to store and preserve your code. Lastly, software engineering also needed in order to get hired by the company.

When it comes to ideal job, I would say that my ideal job is an embedded software engineering. I follow my uncle's steps, he is the person that passed the passionate of coding, especially creating and coding a chip. As far as I know, I have to obtain a lot of knowledges that related to code, program. In addition, my ideal job required that I need to have a strong C language skill, but I have not worked with C language yet, but I hope in the future, I will have a chance to learn C language and able to use it professional.

After taking a look at the Burning Glass data, my opinion of my ideal job has changed because the requirement skill set for my ideal job is not on the top of ranking; it is about top 30 or maybe far than that. To be honest, I will think about my ideal job and will change to the job that required three highest ranked ​IT specific skills​.

My ideal's job is game developer with a strong motivation from my litte brother and friends. With my IT skills and game experience I and combine with other members of the group I personally think Group ideal's job could be IOS developers or mobile game developers. With IOS developer I strongly believe that it would be at the hight rank because of it's requirements and skills and Game developers should be at the middle rank because it is becoming one of the most popular subjects in the world. The skills are needed for these two jobs are master in using the sofware such as UNITY or IOS developer sofware, IT basic skills, Mobile system management and some other soft skills.
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <font color="red"> How do the ​IT-specific skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</font> </li>
<p> It will set a high rank because of the hard skills that required for the job as well as those skills are extremely essential and useful for most of the IT jobs, it not only require general skills such as communication, problem solving, imagination it also inclue main and sub IT skills such as IOS sofware, UNITY, IT bacsic, System management.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> How do the​ general skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</font> </li>
<p> The soft skills like communication, imagination, cooperation, teamwork are really essential beside that they still need to understand the demand of players and users to provide enough benefit and meet their needs.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> What are the three highest-ranked ​IT-specific skills​ which are not in your required skill set?

<p> 3 highest skills rank: SQL, Microsoft C#, LINUX (Burning glass data)
</p>

</font> </li>
<p> After I brief looking at the statistics of ranking in the IT jobs I would say I got confused because game developers is not one of the high rank jobs although it is one of the billion business in the World. However I decided to remain my dream with a new motivation that I would increase the rank of the job in the future because I believe in my passion and the pridiction of some experts about the thrive of video games.

<p> <b>
Thinh:</b> Hello Mr. Dinh. My name is Thinh and as a part of my assignment I am required to do a job. I mean going to interview an IT professional to get about how their daily work.
 </p>

<p><b> Mr. Dinh: </b> It is a pleasure for me to help you with this exercise.
 </p>

<p> <b> Thinh:</b> So, for the first question, can you tell me about your IT work? Like what exactly do you do?
 </p>

<p> <b>Mr. Dinh:</b> Actually, IT work is a very challenging work. IT is a very large picture. It includes software program, network infrastructure, system information management, etc. And specifically for my job, I work for a chip company, an IC design company. In which, the company has many functional departments. From hardware design, software design and board design. I have worked for my company for 17 years. My job is to write the software development kits. That is a software elaborate go along with our product. Includes hardware and software and part of that is SDK software development kit. That applicant provides the customer software components. In which, those components interface the application programming. Interface for customer application software. When customers use our products, first they need to show our chip into their board, the system. After that, they integrate our software into their software system. Then they have an application software. That software will interface to the user or higher layers software and that software also interfaces to our device, our chip through our ADI. We work for the software department. Actually when our marketing team meets the customer to get their requirement to make a new product, we also add a software engineer. We have a long time working in our field and we have experiences to help our marketing team to make clear and to understand the customer requirement. After the marketing team finishes getting the customer requirements, we then analyze and go into more details, then we study specification, standards and applications. Then we design the ADI (group types). After we have the ADI (group types), we can make the simulation environment in which we try to test our ADI. Basically in that simulation platform. After that we see that the ADI can work in the simulation platform then we make the programming guide that helps the customer understand our ADI and program the application. After that we can release that type to our customer soon, so that they can develop their software in an early phase before our chip release to them.
 </p>

<p><b>Thinh:</b> Okay, I got it! Okay! For the next question. Who are all the different people you interact with when you work? And please tell me about them. I mean your colleagues, teammates or something like that.
</p>

<p> <b> Mr. Dinh:</b> Yes, of course. You know when we work for a company and our major will belong to the functional department. Basically, my major work for my software department. And as a member in a project I have to communicate with our software team members. And in that project, we have many teams. That means, got functional team like ours is a software department, software major and another team is hardware. I mean the logic design, the hardware design and another is platform, evaluation platform, bar design. We also communicate with another team like the marketing team or customer support team.
</p>

<p><b>Thinh:</b> Okay! Have you ever worked with any IT professional people?
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Dinh: </b>Yeah. Actually, when I graduated from my university, this company was the first company and the only company that I worked for.
</p>

<p><b>Thinh:</b> Oh really!
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Dinh:</b> Yeah! For 17 years. Actually, the IT work, specifically for my job, is to make software for other businesses. If you make software for a bank, you have to understand the bank business.
</p>
<p><b>Thinh:</b> Oh! I see.
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Dinh: </b>If you make software for our product. Our product is a chip uses for telecom system. That use in a central office or IC provider. Then we have to understand the telecom standard. We have to understand how the circuits, how the packets pro functioning in that system. So that we can design the ADI, design the chip well to serve that business.
</p>
<p><b>Thinh:</b>Okay! What aspect of your work that you spend the most time on?
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Dinh:</b> For the project I joined. Actually, there are many aspects that are challenging. But here I mentioned the testing. The testing takes the most time of the development time. First of all, we understand the customer requirements. After that, we have to design and then we test the quality for the products and up to 60% of the time we spent testing our product, to make sure that the product has quality enough to ship to customers. Then customers use our product to develop their product and you know in the system, there are many chips that communicate together. Our company makes a chip that is a component of that system, and in that system, our chip has to communicate with other chips. Then, building the customer systeme development phase, new issues may come. Even though when they finish the system and they bring the system to interworking with another system, the new issues may come because you know each render make the chip by their own, but we rely on the common specification, but because we are different team, different company, different technology so when interworking we may have problem that we misunderstand with other, so we have to debug to find the issues. After finding the root problems, we have to change our design, implements, and recycle the quality again. Then we deliver a new release to the customer, so that the system can work again.
</p>

</p><b>Thinh:</b> Okay! I think for the final question. Can you share an example of the work that you do the best that captures the essence in your IT industry?
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Dinh:</b> The best what?
</p>
<p><b>Thinh:</b> The best captures. Like your best moments. I mean like your memories. What makes you remember the most.
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Dinh:</b> Yeah! I remember that our company stack with the IT product. We just graduated from our university, no experience. After three years, we did hard work. We had a release, both hardware and software to the customer. They used our product to develop their products. During making their products they made many issues. The issues include their issues and out issues. We have to communicate with them to find the root and fix the issues. Once they finish that system, they bring the system to the field they work with another vendor's equipment. That was a very proud moment. Yeah because we take a long time to develop our products, fixing issues, and helping customers to integrate our product into their system. Then the system is brought to the users to use. Then when their system is enabled in the field, I mean the real network , then users and I make a call and that call signal goes to our device. I felt very happy.
</p>
<p><b>Thinh:</b> Okay! Well, I think this is the end of the interview and thank you for sharing your experience with me and helping me on my assignment.
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Dinh:</b> Okay thank you and you are welcome!

<b> <u> Block chain and Cryptocurrencies: </u> </b>
<p>
Firstly, Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency and is only available in electronic form. It can only be stored and traded through designated computer or software applications, mobile apps, or through a dedicated digital wallet. Some names of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink. Moreover, all of the above coins are operated on a block chain system and it can be traded as real money out there. Cryptocurrencies can be traded through dedicated and secure networks. In addition, Cryptocurrencies are traded on the block chain network. It also brings new benefits to today's technology industry and the economy. Cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity for entrepreneurs or international parties to conduct one-to-one online exchanges without the complications and additional fees that are often associated with relevant international currency exchanges. to a third party. On the other hand, Block chain is the platform that brings electronic money. it is the foundation for creating vehicles of the transaction and enabling the transfer of value and information. The first block chain was invented and designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and realized the following year as a core part of Bitcoin, as block chain technology served as a ledger for all deal. Moreover, Block chains serve as the fundamental underlying technology, of which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem. They go hand in hand, and cryptocurrencies are often needed to transact on a block chain. But without block chain, we wouldn't have the means for these transactions to be recorded and executed. Cryptocurrencies are traded based on block chain technology, each cryptocurrency transaction is a unique exchange between two parties and protecting users from problems such as identity theft. Besides the current features that block chains and cryptocurrencies can offer, there are many uses beyond cryptocurrencies. Block chains are being used to speed cancer research, improve healthcare record sharing and verify people's identities. As an illustration, a large amount of today's top regulators admit that Block chain plays an important role in the success of the banking industry and financial companies, and in the future, will consider using block chain instead. for the current bank transfer system. Not only provide faster, more cost-effective payment methods. Block chain also helps eliminate intermediaries in transactions, allows people to work directly with each other, improving efficiency in sending and receiving electronic coins. In addition, Block chain uses a distributed ledger that provides banks with a customer identification system, allowing users to verify their identity with just one simple step and allowing banks in the same system to access this stored message. In addition, there are many stores around the world - both online and offline - that accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. From large online retailers like Overstock and Newegg to local shops, bars, and restaurants. Bitcoins can be used to pay for hotel rooms, book flights, buy jewelry, buy apps, computer equipment, and even a university degree. Currently, there are many other digital currencies emerging such as Litecoin, XRP, Ethereum, but Bitcoin still occupies a unique position in the form of payment. Things are gradually changing when recently, Apple has supported payment of 10 different electronic coins on the App Store. In the same way, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are being extremely appreciated for the potential that it can develop later. Based on a few examples of famous people in the technology industry, such as Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, investor and philanthropist: "Bitcoin is pretty much better than other currencies in that you don't have to be in the same place to make a big transaction, paper money becomes inconvenient." or Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic and more than 400 other businesses: “I think Bitcoin works. There may be other currencies like that and even better. But for the time being, the world is seeing the rise of a huge industry that revolves around Bitcoin - Everyone gets rich from Bitcoin, some also lose money. Bitcoin fluctuates but people can often still make money from those fluctuations.
</p> <br>
<p> Secondly, Cryptocurrencies and block chain there are positive effects because of the profitability of a cryptocurrency. Another benefit of decentralizing cryptocurrencies is that governments cannot regulate them. As a result, the cryptocurrency is not limited to a specific geographic area and can be traded around the world. Hence, Bitcoin can be used to provide low-cost money transfers, especially for those looking to transfer small amounts of money internationally, such as remittance payments (Scott, 2016). These funds can often be transferred cheaper than central bank-issued currencies, because using cryptocurrencies allows for worldwide financial transfers without the need for an intermediary. In addition, the speed of money transfer is increased by eliminating middlemen. However,  the risks and risks that it brings are undeniable. It appeared that these border independent payments also have some negative aspects that need to be considered. For instance, one characteristic is that it makes it easy to transfer money from illegal activities or fund terrorist operations without the possibility of government intervention. Since this is an independent system, it is very difficult for the government to intervene. The security of this technology is one thing the authorities are suffering from. Furthermore, no government or central bank can influence the supply of cryptocurrencies, as the supply is determined by the underlying protocol of the
cryptocurrency. Consequently, no state can influence the cash flow, which limits the power of government. Due to the loss of government power and the threat of terrorism funding, some countries have banned the use of cryptocurrencies, for example Indonesia has banned cryptocurrencies from being used in their own countries.
</p> <br>
<p> Finally, Cryptocurrencies have a positive effect on me personally. The advent of cryptocurrency and its technological value not only help the technology of the world to develop but each individual can be helped. It is possible to make money and trade those virtual currencies by buying at low value and selling at high value. Furthermore, investing in a calculated and non-obligatory way in connection with any intermediary transaction will give you the ability to legally freely execute transactions. But besides that the lack of understanding in this issue is also a danger because its transactions are easy to let you lose your guard, leading to losing money. There are many people who have been fooled. For example, Bitcoinnet two years ago the bitcoinnet opened up investment packages that only required players to invest money and interest would be returned periodically, which was extremely large 30% of their total investment and a lot of people have participated. and the result for those people is a loss of money invested after a short period of time when these investment packages are active. Since the government is unable to participate in this block chain system, the participants' subsequent filing of lawsuits is virtually meaningless. But if we look at the reality of transparent technologies and their utility, it will be very good if their utilities are legally controlled and developed. That would be a huge step forward for trading.
</p> <br>
<p> In short, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are one of the modern technologies and it needs to be developed more explicitly in order to be legally used. More and more convenience will be promoted more and more because today's demands are changing gradually. In my way of thinking, will be a great advantage for those who learn and study more closely about cryptocurrencies and block chains can do in the future.

<b> <u> Cybersecurity: </u> </b>
<p>
  Have you ever imagined how your internet system is being protected? Cybersecurity is the modest technology that helps the users to feel safe while they are using the internet. Moreover, this technology had been applied worldwide, especially large companies often used this tech for instance Facebook, Instagram, and Google. On the other hand, cyber threats evolved so quickly which made the process of access into a large cooperation computer to steal valuable information become easier, and it made it difficult to get ahead of cyber criminals. Therefore, cybersecurity must be updated each time in order to face dangerous threats which means there is a non-stop process of improving the cybersecurity technology. Currently, there are some new states of cybersecurity such as collaboration to protect supply chains, securing the public cloud, and the rise of zero trust systems.
</p> <br>
<p> Margaret Rouse, a writer of Whatls, specialized in the IT sector said these days internet security can be done far better than the last few years. In addition, businesses are comfortable with their cyber security, and they positively believe the effectiveness of it. Rouse analyzes that cybersecurity significantly changes the privacy of the world wide web. Moreover, there are many benefits such as protecting data, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining the brand image of the product for both developer and clients. Despite the fact that cyber criminals are more delicate in various ways, the internet securely always pushes their work to the limit in order to block the access of those dangerous hackers. Why must we pay a fee for the internet charge every single month? Everything is developed or improved throughout the time, software and viruses are not exceptional. Therefore, these IT people must confront the threats of cyber criminals as well as figure out the solution whenever any new viruses are being spread.
</p> <br>
<p> For the next 3 years, it is predicted that cybersecurity could deal with a large amount of threats which not simply as before. Moreover online criminals are becoming more devious as they insert harmful code into the system to be able to break through the firewall. In contrast, cybersecurity wll respond faster if any unauthorized logon is happening as well as repetitive warning messages to the domain. Another prediction about cybersecurity is that deepfakes will be resolved soon. Furthermore, there will be a high tech software which can prevent the fake mail that is being sent to companies to rob the vital information. This information can be sold for up to a hundred million dollar if someone wants to know other competitors' plans. Some famous anti virus software such as Kaspersky will be upgraded to deal with the dangerous source code form hackers, delete any unusual file in our PC.  These predictions could be right or wrong but I think this is the bright future for our cybersecurity market.
</p> <br>
<p> Soft skills and hard skills are both required for the reason to develop a more secure internet environment. For soft skills there are some categories that need to be put into practice more like concentrating on details, creative and problem solving, mindset, and staying calm in every situation . On the one hand, hard skills consist of basic structure of computer science, understanding about one or more code languages, and having experience in this field. Cloud is one of the foremost examples I can mention which is probably very familiar with students, people at all ages. Besides that, hardware authentication is also being recommended in the list of technologies that support the growth of cybersecurity in the future. Although these software was already well-known to people, they still need maintenance and improvement because the criminals never stop to create unique viruses for us to find a solution and destroy them.
</p>
<p>
Having the right software to stop someone accessing your PC remotely does have a huge impact on the society. The software that was mentioned before helps citizens to freely use the internet without any consideration of hackers tracking our conversation, or getting private pictures from our phones. Moreover, it creates a strong bond between customers and internet providers where people's privacy is what they must respect and protect it against any kind of threats. The technology and the way the software process are the key answer to things that could possibly change. For instance, any software has a lot of versions for itself, 2.04, 2.05, and 2.06, why do you think they need to create too many versions of one software? The threats never stop improving their technology so there must not be any relevant reasons for us to stop evolving and stop the action of those thefts that are against the law. The citizen is probably the one who is being affected by these technologies. When I said this, most people have the idea about how they get influence from this software. Basically, if a person has to deal with medium virus such as malware, ransomware, the antivirus software can be used to stop the problems immediately. Softwares cannot replace humans or any job cut off, people put their effort and time in a product to be able to resolve all the issues whenever a new virus attack is incoming. Cloud is also an online tool that secures your private files for instance videos, images, database, speech, etc, and this tool performance was absolutely amazing due to how secure it is. Furthermore, people all over the world use cloud storage as one of their official drives, therefore the cloud must have modest technology where the viruses cannot flow through the firewall to get access into the files.
</p> <br>
<p>
In my daily life, I am always scared that my computer is being hacked by someone, and my secret files can be lost. Moreover, some hackers steal and tell us we must pay for them a large amount of money in order to get the files back. Therefore, after access to some unusual website, or accidentally click on a link that could contain viruses, the antivirus software is the best option for me to scan for threats and remove them. Although cybersecurity is still evolving throughout the time, I recommend that they should create a new software that could totally face all threats.
<p> <br>
<p>
Personally, the different things to myself is that I have some technological knowledge that definitely supports me to figure out some basic ways of hackers spreading harmful code. For example, fishing and farming are two typical types of hiding virus in the mail, another one is advertisement link: “ Click on this link and you will receive a chance to get $1000000”. These techniques are old but some new internet users still got tricked because they thought nothing happened to their computers, actually a virus has been installed into the PC and deleted some important files from our pc or tracking username password of our social media sites. My family and friends may have similar knowledge to mine, therefore if they face a more advanced threat, this is where professional software must be used to remove the dangerous issues. My family does not understand much about technology stuff which can be easily hacked, therefore Kaspersky for instance will show a warning to ask if we want to continue to access a link where it contains viruses or not. Moreover, it can eventually block any site that the program can detect any kind of virus for easy one to complicated one.

<b> <u> Robots: </u> </b>
<p>I am pretty sure that you heard about the word “robots” a lot, but do you know what “robots” actually is? Robots are a type of machine that can work automatically by controllers, computers or even by coded circuits. Moreover, depending on what works needed then robots will have a different appearance. For example, NASA wanted to explore the Mars, so they created a robot that called Curiosity to discover the Mars. As far as I know, Curiosity is a robot that has a shape like a car, and Curiosity’s mission is to discover the Gale volcano. In my opinion, the art of technology is something really special because it keeps changing or upgrading constantly day by day. Nowadays, there are a lot of things that can be completed by robots even the job that required a group of people to complete that. </p> <br>
<p>If memory serves, I read an article about robots last 2 weeks and I really impressed that what can be done by a robot at 2020. For instance, in 2018, there was a startup called Starship Technologies created the delivery robots that used six-wheeled and self-driving technology to navigate the location to deliver the packages in a small city from northwest of London. The author said that the first time he saw the delivery robot, he thought that it is cute but pointless. However, due to the lockdown that caused by Coronavirus, this robot become the most useful machine in 2020. Because it helps people who want to order anything from grocery but they cannot go outside and buy it, so they order it online and wait the delivery robot ship it to them. Moreover, I found that Amazon has a delivery robot which named is Scout, Scout also used six-wheeled and self-driving technology as well, but there is a negative side is that it is only delivery to “Prime customers”. </p> <br>
<p>To me, in the near future, the development of the robotics will make a huge change to the world; one of the changes that I hope it will able to done soon is the Firefighter robots. My ex-roommate was a firefighter in Chicago, as far as I know that Chicago has a high percentage of conflagration and sometimes it really hard to control it. Unfortunately, my roommate passed away when he tried to rescue a family that stuck inside the building. Therefore, it would be great if firefighter robots will be created soon and it will be used by government only. In my opinion, to make this possible, we need to spend a lot of money, time and materials. To start with, I am going to talk about the technological on this robot. First of all, we need to create an extremely sensitive sensor that can detect human’s heart beat or brainwaves. For example, when people stuck inside the building and they are covering by smoke; they cannot breathe but their heart beat and brainwaves still working. Therefore, the robots can detect that and locate their position to come and rescue them. Secondly, we need to add for the robots the short “voice-message” like “I am a firefighter robot, I am here to save you” to let people know it is the firefighter robots that come and rescue them. Last but not least, we need to make the robots a little big but flexible. Thus, the main reason that the robots need to big because it will have the cabin inside to let people stay inside the cabin, and flexible to move fast to save people. Next, I am going to point out the materials of the robots. In my point of view, the robots need to have a best material in case it will be burnt by the fire when they go inside the fire. In addition, the outside materials of the robots must to be the insulating materials like heat proof, and inside of the robots need to be the material that can turn heat into cool. In my perspective, the potential impact of this development will be about the safety of humanity. According to the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), it said that more than 50 firefighters died in the conflagration each year because firefighter is a dangerous job. Therefore, if the firefighter robots can be created, it will decrease the death percentage of firefighters; moreover, there are no firefighters will die when they try to rescue someone.
</p> <br>
<p>However, this change will affect the most to the firefighter’s job. I mean that the robots are going to decrease the job, and maybe that the real firefighters will lose their job. In general, if the robotics grow up in the next few years, I think it will create an economy crisis; because robotics will replace the job that human can do, so when people lose their job, they will need to wait for the support from government. To me, everything has both aspects, one is positive, another is negative. For example, robots should be created to do dangerous jobs such as firefighters, explore the volcano, etc. And let human do the traditional job like work on the factory, or sometimes pack all the stuff. Currently, there are a few jobs that were replaced by robots, but I just name a major job that got replaced. The first job that replaced by robots is telemarketers, this is kind of a robot-calls with a variety services. Then, the most popular is the cashier, in 2018, Walmart launched the first cashier robots, the robot’s eyes have a sensor that can scan the bar code and can help customers check out. As an IT student, I think this will affect me a lot. After reading those articles, I feel like that I have a lot of energies to create something new and better for the world. However, I am really concerned about if this is going to develop in the future. For example, if you can create a robot that can do multitask that means it will be extremely hard to fix (complicated program) when it broke or bugged; so, I think this problem will make everything a little bit difficult for me to work on my project. On the other hand, I think that my family members such as my dad and mom will love these technologies in the future. As I remember, my dad told me to create for him a robot that can cook for him and my mom, so, my mom does not to worry about the cooking stuff. To be honest, I think everything always have 2 aspects, but if you create a robot to help your family members that will be fine. However, as I said above, robots should be created to do dangerous job only.

<b> <u> Machine learning: </u> </b>
<p> Basically machine learning is a supported system of an artifact intelligence which could generate data and recognize existing algorithms to operate a significant solution and action (Lina Klass, 2018). There are too many types of development machine learning in all over the world, some of the most popular ML include firstly a digital data forgetting in ML prefer to be called as Machine unlearning which is kind of the opposite way to use this kind of system. With the development of technology in recent years there are tons of data that have been created and it is going to overwhelm the space to store and save our data that is why digital data forgetting systems become useful for receiving unnecessary data and removing it from the system. In addition, another famous ML call automated one which allow the app to operate the solution automatically with a better and easier as well as quicker method, for example, the internet need to absorb and deal with the huge amount of date every second to convert and control those data into specific action but with this automated ML the internet will have much more way to convert data and make more valuable action at the same time (Top Machine Learning Trends in 2019 - GeeksforGeeks, 2020). Moreover the world has created some other ML such as interoperability among neutral networks, The place of convergence and the language generator for customer support all of these types of machine learning is the state of the art in recent years. So with these popular kind of ML and some other unique as well as unofficial one could make simply the code or make more space for computer system to be able to store and analyze much more data to provide services, it also support our daily life with some useful benefit such as intelligent gaming, automated transportation, cyborg technology, becoming an virtual worker in dangerous jobs, protecting working environment, improving health care, development in banking,... (15 Ways Machine Learning Will Impact Your Everyday Life, 2020). The future of machine learning could be wide and hard to imagine, according to 5 most famous experts in ML we could see some of the advanced ML could be created or develop in some years later. Firstly is about fine-tuned personalization so this ML is about taking data used by customer of  IoT devices like smartphones, cars and analyze those data to see what could be the appropriate and priority parts of system for the next update in those products so with the future advance ML we could see how it convey information of the large amount of tagert and fine – tuned personalization in a big scenario. Secondly is about the search engine which mostly used by human, Google search become popular to everyone in the world because of its function but Dorit Zilbershot concluded that with the future ML searching engine could be develop much more efficient, the result given will be more relevant to the questions with a deep and insight method, the searching engine will generate a high quality and quantity in result and manufacture the result base on personal information of searcher, it can also produce an appropriate solution for those question based on advices from experts. To be able to make these future ML some technology had been develop such as Self – learning bots which is a product from DDI development and some other factor such as computer vision and neuron – linguistic programing. </p> <br>
<p>   With the development of Machine learning, in recent years it could impact people's lives in multiple dimensions such as economics, health care, data visualization, advanced analytic, big data transformation,... Depending on how people use machine learning for different purposes it would operate the system following people's demands, for example machine learning impacts people in social life as entertainment section, the smartphone with automated system, video games with intelligent AI, social media like Facebook or Tiktok. The demand of using machine learning will be remain the same but the benefit and the impact will be changed in the future depend a lot on people demand, with the large amount of data had been collected by ML in plenty of different objects it could be self-developing and make the ML become much more useful and intelligent. The change is not only applicable in the way it produces algorithms and the method of enhancing algorithms but also in the new section of advanced AI, how can Machine learning manufacturing to be appropriate with future AI could be one of the most difficult in science development. In addition, there are plenty of ML that people use in recent years to serve their need and services, the recent use of machine learning that impact people live is Covid 19 prediction, the ML will analyze data of the revolution of this virus to possibly giving out some upcoming solution to cure or prevent base on the data collected from previous patients. Conveying the information it collected to experts for producing appropriate vaccine and increase the chance of preventing Covid 19 in multiple aspects of living, otherwise generate potential advice for preventing than just wearing masks or using hand wash liquid. Other normal use of machine learning is searching engines in Google platforms or in social media such as Facebook or Tiktok to serve the daily life of humans in a better way. However, is this kind of advanced science could replace the works of humans? I would say it is impossible to replace but it is great to support, with the new and modern machine learning people would be easier in working with technology but there is no machine could be smart as people because people are the host.</p> <br>
<p>   As a student of IT programing I would say there are so many machine learning that affect me in daily life, first of all is about training with automatic machine learning on the internet, I often used the typing training to train the speed of typing or playing chess game with a bot on the internet to train my skill and brain and some of friends told me that there is a Dating game which give you a chance to create your own girlfriend and it is a machine learning to collect your hoppy, your personality to create an appropriate mate. Secondly social media is part of my life and other people, every morning when i wake up the first I properly do is checking my Facebook to see how many offline messages or any news in the news feed, moreover the usage of machine learning in social media is spread in all over the world that is why it is so convenient and flexible to absorb knowledge or any other information with just a simple smartphone or computer. Finally it is affecting my job in translating documents for my client, in my translation software call CAT tool, there is always an available section of machine learning to translate some simple sentences or any sentences that I wrote down, the good use of it is to remember the same sentences and generate the solution immediately for me to reduce the working time. With these efficient benefits of machine learning I think it would properly affect my friends and family in the same way or may be much more for them because the usage of ML is worldwide and various in multiple subjects of live so it is quite hard to imagine how big this kind of intellect machine is.

<h2> <font color="red"> Project Ideas: </font> </h2>
<p><mark> <b> Overview:</b> </mark> Overall, this will be a smart and automatic watering project. This project will include the installation of a sprinkler system and temperature sensor system for each area separately. Moreover, this is not only a simple automatic watering project but also includes an analysis of the plant's condition and its growth environment. It will help optimize plant growth and achieve the same results on a large scale. Because of that, such benefits save labor, time and quantity of production will be significantly increased. This will be a technology suitable for Vietnam's environment, it will help farmers and industry of Vietnam to achieve success in the future.
</p>
<p> <mark> <b> Description:</b> </mark> A smart and automatic watering project will have 2 main steps which are to set irrigation and ambient sensor systems. Firstly, the irrigation system will be distributed correctly in each area so that when watering will ensure the amount of water to water the plants in an equal amount. For instance, the installation of an automatic irrigation system for orange trees will be the position between the 4 trees, it will help when watering those 4 orange trees will have an equal amount of water and at the same time of day. Moreover, even if a farm is guaranteed that every tree will have the same watering regime, the quality of the oranges will always be the same and guaranteed. Besides orange trees, all such agricultural produce as vegetables, potatoes and even ornamental plants will have similar results.
</p>
<p> Secondly, ambient sensor systems will also be installed based on application calculations. This system will be placed high above and around the habitat of these trees and all other surrounding areas. Moreover, their task will be to collect information about temperature, light, humidity and wind to give information about the center of the application. Accordingly, according to the data that the application has collected, the programmed system will analyze the status of the trees in each area, which will result in how to provide suitable and timely solutions for trees. On the other hand, after receiving information and analysis from ambient sensor systems, there will be a programmed program for the watering system to adjust the amount of water accordingly (this amount of water will include fertilizer dissolve in water to come). For instance, on dry days, ambient sensor systems will notify the system's main center that the orange tree area is in need of water and this dry environment will directly affect the tree. Based on the analytical information, the irrigation system will be adjusted to irrigate with more water and appropriate fertilizer to help stabilize the orange trees.
</p>
<p> Finally, once the system is complete, its owners can directly view the status of the plants through analysis and reports of ambient sensor systems. Moreover, the user will not need to go directly to the planting area to control the device because the system will be integrated on the system's computer and will grow to be compatible with the phone if the user is not directly located at the computer-controlled position. For example, when the system owner does not need to go to the location of each tree in hot weather but instead in the control area to check everything on the data. In addition, when they have a job they cannot stay on the farm and have to go to another city, they can still connect to the device by phone to control and check the situation of the tree. In short, an intelligent and automatic watering project will be installed with all the information based on the most accurate experts to ensure that there will be no errors in interpreting and adjusting the water volume for suitable.

<p> Here is my feedback about each member of the group: Thịnh is a quite nervous when we first met but when we start working together he showed extremely great ability in GitHub and Atom, he is a shy person but it does not affect his communication skills and he is kind with other members and pretty good at solving problems. Anh Tuan is a strict person with strong emotions but he shows how good he is as a leader even he is new to the group, he not only help me to build the code with github but also fix and debug some of my issues, he was helping other members and keeping track the whole project to ensure all the member are working well. Finally the last member is Cheng who is quite mysterious because I did not have a chance to meet him I only work online with him but I can realize how good is his responsibility, moreover I could learn alot from him in coding and decorating website.

<p> Towards the end of the assignment period, I personally think my performance in this team is just quite enough to accomplish my duty because my IT skills and knowledge are not good enough to be able to help my team mates so I tried to do my parts and then the rest members gave me some advices to solve problems. After all I think the group has done the assignment quite great with all the sections that we need and some highlight parts with great expectation in IT work and IT technology. Me as a member of the group I need to improve a lot in my IT skills such as Atom or Github and train a little bit in my communication skill. I was so surprising that the assignment finished on time with great decoration of the github website and I learned a lot from my groups from the method of using Atom, the way handling issues, how to fix the bug and make the whole performance look even better
