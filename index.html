The previous job idea I chose was IOS developers. There are two main groups of skills of my ideal jobs are general skills and IT-specific skills.
On the one hand, general skills in IOS developer needed key requirements such as good communication skills in English and working experience in iOS development.
On the other hand, IT-specific skills in IOS developer requirements such as working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, architectures, trends, and emerging technologies. As for the required programming languages, there are Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.

<p> The requirement of the iOS developer recruiter is to have experience with working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, emerging architecture, trends and technologies. Besides, the requirement for minimum languages to do it on the iOS platform is Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.

</font> </li>
<p> The general skills of an iOS developer should have key requirements such as good English communication skills and experience working in the iOS development field.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> What are the three highest-ranked ​IT-specific skills​ which are not in your required skill set?
</font> </li>
<p> Based on the Burning Glass Data table from May, 2017 to March 2018, there are 3 highest ranked programming languages based on Australian statistics: SQL, Java Script and Microsoft Windows. All three languages above are not included in the job requirements I selected.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
</font> </li>
<p> After looked at the burning glass data, I decided to change my idea job because based on the statistics from May 2017 to March 2018, all the language required of the idea job I was selections are not at the top of the selected language. Although communication skills make up the highest percentage of general skills, I find that it can only really work if my required language has the same level of influence. In addition, learning a language for the IOS platform is a unique request of the employers so it is possible to limit the ability to work in the future.

<b> <u> Block chain and Cryptocurrencies: </u> </b>
<p>
Firstly, Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency and is only available in electronic form. It can only be stored and traded through designated computer or software applications, mobile apps, or through a dedicated digital wallet. Some names of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink. Moreover, all of the above coins are operated on a block chain system and it can be traded as real money out there. Cryptocurrencies can be traded through dedicated and secure networks. In addition, Cryptocurrencies are traded on the block chain network. It also brings new benefits to today's technology industry and the economy. Cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity for entrepreneurs or international parties to conduct one-to-one online exchanges without the complications and additional fees that are often associated with relevant international currency exchanges. to a third party. On the other hand, Block chain is the platform that brings electronic money. it is the foundation for creating vehicles of the transaction and enabling the transfer of value and information. The first block chain was invented and designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and realized the following year as a core part of Bitcoin, as block chain technology served as a ledger for all deal. Moreover, Block chains serve as the fundamental underlying technology, of which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem. They go hand in hand, and cryptocurrencies are often needed to transact on a block chain. But without block chain, we wouldn't have the means for these transactions to be recorded and executed. Cryptocurrencies are traded based on block chain technology, each cryptocurrency transaction is a unique exchange between two parties and protecting users from problems such as identity theft. Besides the current features that block chains and cryptocurrencies can offer, there are many uses beyond cryptocurrencies. Block chains are being used to speed cancer research, improve healthcare record sharing and verify people's identities. As an illustration, a large amount of today's top regulators admit that Block chain plays an important role in the success of the banking industry and financial companies, and in the future, will consider using block chain instead. for the current bank transfer system. Not only provide faster, more cost-effective payment methods. Block chain also helps eliminate intermediaries in transactions, allows people to work directly with each other, improving efficiency in sending and receiving electronic coins. In addition, Block chain uses a distributed ledger that provides banks with a customer identification system, allowing users to verify their identity with just one simple step and allowing banks in the same system to access this stored message. In addition, there are many stores around the world - both online and offline - that accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. From large online retailers like Overstock and Newegg to local shops, bars, and restaurants. Bitcoins can be used to pay for hotel rooms, book flights, buy jewelry, buy apps, computer equipment, and even a university degree. Currently, there are many other digital currencies emerging such as Litecoin, XRP, Ethereum, but Bitcoin still occupies a unique position in the form of payment. Things are gradually changing when recently, Apple has supported payment of 10 different electronic coins on the App Store. In the same way, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are being extremely appreciated for the potential that it can develop later. Based on a few examples of famous people in the technology industry, such as Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, investor and philanthropist: "Bitcoin is pretty much better than other currencies in that you don't have to be in the same place to make a big transaction, paper money becomes inconvenient." or Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic and more than 400 other businesses: “I think Bitcoin works. There may be other currencies like that and even better. But for the time being, the world is seeing the rise of a huge industry that revolves around Bitcoin - Everyone gets rich from Bitcoin, some also lose money. Bitcoin fluctuates but people can often still make money from those fluctuations.
</p> <br>
<p> Secondly, Cryptocurrencies and block chain there are positive effects because of the profitability of a cryptocurrency. Another benefit of decentralizing cryptocurrencies is that governments cannot regulate them. As a result, the cryptocurrency is not limited to a specific geographic area and can be traded around the world. Hence, Bitcoin can be used to provide low-cost money transfers, especially for those looking to transfer small amounts of money internationally, such as remittance payments (Scott, 2016). These funds can often be transferred cheaper than central bank-issued currencies, because using cryptocurrencies allows for worldwide financial transfers without the need for an intermediary. In addition, the speed of money transfer is increased by eliminating middlemen. However,  the risks and risks that it brings are undeniable. It appeared that these border independent payments also have some negative aspects that need to be considered. For instance, one characteristic is that it makes it easy to transfer money from illegal activities or fund terrorist operations without the possibility of government intervention. Since this is an independent system, it is very difficult for the government to intervene. The security of this technology is one thing the authorities are suffering from. Furthermore, no government or central bank can influence the supply of cryptocurrencies, as the supply is determined by the underlying protocol of the
cryptocurrency. Consequently, no state can influence the cash flow, which limits the power of government. Due to the loss of government power and the threat of terrorism funding, some countries have banned the use of cryptocurrencies, for example Indonesia has banned cryptocurrencies from being used in their own countries.
</p> <br>
<p> Finally, Cryptocurrencies have a positive effect on me personally. The advent of cryptocurrency and its technological value not only help the technology of the world to develop but each individual can be helped. It is possible to make money and trade those virtual currencies by buying at low value and selling at high value. Furthermore, investing in a calculated and non-obligatory way in connection with any intermediary transaction will give you the ability to legally freely execute transactions. But besides that the lack of understanding in this issue is also a danger because its transactions are easy to let you lose your guard, leading to losing money. There are many people who have been fooled. For example, Bitcoinnet two years ago the bitcoinnet opened up investment packages that only required players to invest money and interest would be returned periodically, which was extremely large 30% of their total investment and a lot of people have participated. and the result for those people is a loss of money invested after a short period of time when these investment packages are active. Since the government is unable to participate in this block chain system, the participants' subsequent filing of lawsuits is virtually meaningless. But if we look at the reality of transparent technologies and their utility, it will be very good if their utilities are legally controlled and developed. That would be a huge step forward for trading.
</p> <br>
<p> In short, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are one of the modern technologies and it needs to be developed more explicitly in order to be legally used. More and more convenience will be promoted more and more because today's demands are changing gradually. In my way of thinking, will be a great advantage for those who learn and study more closely about cryptocurrencies and block chains can do in the future.

<b> <u> Robots </u> </b>
<p>I am pretty sure that you heard about the word “robots” a lot, but do you know what “robots” actually is? Robots are a type of machine that can work automatically by controllers, computers or even by coded circuits. Moreover, depending on what works needed then robots will have a different appearance. For example, NASA wanted to explore the Mars, so they created a robot that called Curiosity to discover the Mars. As far as I know, Curiosity is a robot that has a shape like a car, and Curiosity’s mission is to discover the Gale volcano. In my opinion, the art of technology is something really special because it keeps changing or upgrading constantly day by day. Nowadays, there are a lot of things that can be completed by robots even the job that required a group of people to complete that. If memory serves, I read an article about robots last 2 weeks and I really impressed that what can be done by a robot at 2020. For instance, in 2018, there was a startup called Starship Technologies created the delivery robots that used six-wheeled and self-driving technology to navigate the location to deliver the packages in a small city from northwest of London. The author said that the first time he saw the delivery robot, he thought that it is cute but pointless. However, due to the lockdown that caused by Coronavirus, this robot become the most useful machine in 2020. Because it helps people who want to order anything from grocery but they cannot go outside and buy it, so they order it online and wait the delivery robot ship it to them. Moreover, I found that Amazon has a delivery robot which named is Scout, Scout also used six-wheeled and self-driving technology as well, but there is a negative side is that it is only delivery to “Prime customers”.
</p> <br>
<p>To me, in the near future, the development of the robotics will make a huge change to the world; one of the changes that I hope it will able to done soon is the Firefighter robots. My ex-roommate was a firefighter in Chicago, as far as I know that Chicago has a high percentage of conflagration and sometimes it really hard to control it. Unfortunately, my roommate passed away when he tried to rescue a family that stuck inside the building. Therefore, it would be great if firefighter robots will be created soon and it will be used by government only. In my opinion, to make this possible, we need to spend a lot of money, time and materials. To start with, I am going to talk about the technological on this robot. First of all, we need to create an extremely sensitive sensor that can detect human’s heart beat or brainwaves. For example, when people stuck inside the building and they are covering by smoke; they cannot breathe but their heart beat and brainwaves still working. Therefore, the robots can detect that and locate their position to come and rescue them. Secondly, we need to add for the robots the short “voice-message” like “I am a firefighter robot, I am here to save you” to let people know it is the firefighter robots that come and rescue them. Last but not least, we need to make the robots a little big but flexible. Thus, the main reason that the robots need to big because it will have the cabin inside to let people stay inside the cabin, and flexible to move fast to save people. Next, I am going to point out the materials of the robots. In my point of view, the robots need to have a best material in case it will be burnt by the fire when they go inside the fire. In addition, the outside materials of the robots must to be the insulating materials like heat proof, and inside of the robots need to be the material that can turn heat into cool. In my perspective, the potential impact of this development will be about the safety of humanity. According to the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), it said that more than 50 firefighters died in the conflagration each year because firefighter is a dangerous job. Therefore, if the firefighter robots can be created, it will decrease the death percentage of firefighters; moreover, there are no firefighters will die when they try to rescue someone.
</p> <br>
<p>However, this change will affect the most to the firefighter’s job. I mean that the robots are going to decrease the job, and maybe that the real firefighters will lose their job. In general, if the robotics grow up in the next few years, I think it will create an economy crisis; because robotics will replace the job that human can do, so when people lose their job, they will need to wait for the support from government. To me, everything has both aspects, one is positive, another is negative. For example, robots should be created to do dangerous jobs such as firefighters, explore the volcano, etc. And let human do the traditional job like work on the factory, or sometimes pack all the stuff. Currently, there are a few jobs that were replaced by robots, but I just name a major job that got replaced. The first job that replaced by robots is telemarketers, this is kind of a robot-calls with a variety services. Then, the most popular is the cashier, in 2018, Walmart launched the first cashier robots, the robot’s eyes have a sensor that can scan the bar code and can help customers check out. As an IT student, I think this will affect me a lot. After reading those articles, I feel like that I have a lot of energies to create something new and better for the world. However, I am really concerned about if this is going to develop in the future. For example, if you can create a robot that can do multitask that means it will be extremely hard to fix (complicated program) when it broke or bugged; so, I think this problem will make everything a little bit difficult for me to work on my project. On the other hand, I think that my family members such as my dad and mom will love these technologies in the future. As I remember, my dad told me to create for him a robot that can cook for him and my mom, so, my mom does not to worry about the cooking stuff. To be honest, I think everything always have 2 aspects, but if you create a robot to help your family members that will be fine. However, as I said above, robots should be created to do dangerous job only.

<h2> <font color="red"> Project Ideas: </font> </h2>
<p><mark> <b> Overview:</b> </mark> Overall, this will be a smart and automatic watering project. This project will include the installation of a sprinkler system and temperature sensor system for each area separately. Moreover, this is not only a simple automatic watering project but also includes an analysis of the plant's condition and its growth environment. It will help optimize plant growth and achieve the same results on a large scale. Because of that, such benefits save labor, time and quantity of production will be significantly increased. This will be a technology suitable for Vietnam's environment, it will help farmers and industry of Vietnam to achieve success in the future.
</p>
<p> <mark> <b> Description:</b> </mark> A smart and automatic watering project will have 2 main steps which are to set irrigation and ambient sensor systems. Firstly, the irrigation system will be distributed correctly in each area so that when watering will ensure the amount of water to water the plants in an equal amount. For instance, the installation of an automatic irrigation system for orange trees will be the position between the 4 trees, it will help when watering those 4 orange trees will have an equal amount of water and at the same time of day. Moreover, even if a farm is guaranteed that every tree will have the same watering regime, the quality of the oranges will always be the same and guaranteed. Besides orange trees, all such agricultural produce as vegetables, potatoes and even ornamental plants will have similar results.
</p>
<p> Secondly, ambient sensor systems will also be installed based on application calculations. This system will be placed high above and around the habitat of these trees and all other surrounding areas. Moreover, their task will be to collect information about temperature, light, humidity and wind to give information about the center of the application. Accordingly, according to the data that the application has collected, the programmed system will analyze the status of the trees in each area, which will result in how to provide suitable and timely solutions for trees. On the other hand, after receiving information and analysis from ambient sensor systems, there will be a programmed program for the watering system to adjust the amount of water accordingly (this amount of water will include fertilizer dissolve in water to come). For instance, on dry days, ambient sensor systems will notify the system's main center that the orange tree area is in need of water and this dry environment will directly affect the tree. Based on the analytical information, the irrigation system will be adjusted to irrigate with more water and appropriate fertilizer to help stabilize the orange trees.
</p>
<p> Finally, once the system is complete, its owners can directly view the status of the plants through analysis and reports of ambient sensor systems. Moreover, the user will not need to go directly to the planting area to control the device because the system will be integrated on the system's computer and will grow to be compatible with the phone if the user is not directly located at the computer-controlled position. For example, when the system owner does not need to go to the location of each tree in hot weather but instead in the control area to check everything on the data. In addition, when they have a job they cannot stay on the farm and have to go to another city, they can still connect to the device by phone to control and check the situation of the tree. In short, an intelligent and automatic watering project will be installed with all the information based on the most accurate experts to ensure that there will be no errors in interpreting and adjusting the water volume for suitable.
