The previous job idea I chose was IOS developers. There are two main groups of skills of my ideal jobs are general skills and IT-specific skills.
On the one hand, general skills in IOS developer needed key requirements such as good communication skills in English and working experience in iOS development.
On the other hand, IT-specific skills in IOS developer requirements such as working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, architectures, trends, and emerging technologies. As for the required programming languages, there are Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.

<p> The requirement of the iOS developer recruiter is to have experience with working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, emerging architecture, trends and technologies. Besides, the requirement for minimum languages to do it on the iOS platform is Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> How do the​ general skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</font> </li>
<p> The general skills of an iOS developer should have key requirements such as good English communication skills and experience working in the iOS development field.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> What are the three highest-ranked ​IT-specific skills​ which are not in your required skill set?
</font> </li>
<p> Based on the Burning Glass Data table from May, 2017 to March 2018, there are 3 highest ranked programming languages based on Australian statistics: SQL, Java Script and Microsoft Windows. All three languages above are not included in the job requirements I selected.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
</font> </li>
<p> After looked at the burning glass data, I decided to change my idea job because based on the statistics from May 2017 to March 2018, all the language required of the idea job I was selections are not at the top of the selected language. Although communication skills make up the highest percentage of general skills, I find that it can only really work if my required language has the same level of influence. In addition, learning a language for the IOS platform is a unique request of the employers so it is possible to limit the ability to work in the future.

<p> <u>2. What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
</u> </p>
<p> Bill Gates does not interact with a few people, he interacts with everyone. When he first started a company, he was worried about his employees because Bill Gates didn't hire a lot of people at the time and all the employees were older than him. Later when he became a philanthropist, he interacted with everyone from investors, everyone related to the relevant field. For instance, Bill Gates is very concerned with US education and he listens to every children's feedback or global health when investing money in vaccines.
</p>
<p> <u> 3. Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time? </u> </p>
<p> Bill Gates used to spend all of the day just learning and focusing on Microsoft development. He was a big fan of software before he started writing about Microsoft.

<h2> <font color="red"> IT Technologies: </font> </h2>
<b> <u> Block chain and Cryptocurrencies: </u> </b>
<p>
Firstly, Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency and is only available in electronic form. It can only be stored and traded through designated computer or software applications, mobile apps, or through a dedicated digital wallet. Some names of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink. Moreover, all of the above coins are operated on a block chain system and it can be traded as real money out there. Cryptocurrencies can be traded through dedicated and secure networks. In addition, Cryptocurrencies are traded on the block chain network. It also brings new benefits to today's technology industry and the economy. Cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity for entrepreneurs or international parties to conduct one-to-one online exchanges without the complications and additional fees that are often associated with relevant international currency exchanges. to a third party. On the other hand, Block chain is the platform that brings electronic money. it is the foundation for creating vehicles of the transaction and enabling the transfer of value and information. The first block chain was invented and designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and realized the following year as a core part of Bitcoin, as block chain technology served as a ledger for all deal. Moreover, Block chains serve as the fundamental underlying technology, of which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem. They go hand in hand, and cryptocurrencies are often needed to transact on a block chain. But without block chain, we wouldn't have the means for these transactions to be recorded and executed. Cryptocurrencies are traded based on block chain technology, each cryptocurrency transaction is a unique exchange between two parties and protecting users from problems such as identity theft. Besides the current features that block chains and cryptocurrencies can offer, there are many uses beyond cryptocurrencies. Block chains are being used to speed cancer research, improve healthcare record sharing and verify people's identities. As an illustration, a large amount of today's top regulators admit that Block chain plays an important role in the success of the banking industry and financial companies, and in the future, will consider using block chain instead. for the current bank transfer system. Not only provide faster, more cost-effective payment methods. Block chain also helps eliminate intermediaries in transactions, allows people to work directly with each other, improving efficiency in sending and receiving electronic coins. In addition, Block chain uses a distributed ledger that provides banks with a customer identification system, allowing users to verify their identity with just one simple step and allowing banks in the same system to access this stored message. In addition, there are many stores around the world - both online and offline - that accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. From large online retailers like Overstock and Newegg to local shops, bars, and restaurants. Bitcoins can be used to pay for hotel rooms, book flights, buy jewelry, buy apps, computer equipment, and even a university degree. Currently, there are many other digital currencies emerging such as Litecoin, XRP, Ethereum, but Bitcoin still occupies a unique position in the form of payment. Things are gradually changing when recently, Apple has supported payment of 10 different electronic coins on the App Store. In the same way, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are being extremely appreciated for the potential that it can develop later. Based on a few examples of famous people in the technology industry, such as Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, investor and philanthropist: "Bitcoin is pretty much better than other currencies in that you don't have to be in the same place to make a big transaction, paper money becomes inconvenient." or Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic and more than 400 other businesses: “I think Bitcoin works. There may be other currencies like that and even better. But for the time being, the world is seeing the rise of a huge industry that revolves around Bitcoin - Everyone gets rich from Bitcoin, some also lose money. Bitcoin fluctuates but people can often still make money from those fluctuations.
</p> <br>
<p> Secondly, Cryptocurrencies and block chain there are positive effects because of the profitability of a cryptocurrency. Another benefit of decentralizing cryptocurrencies is that governments cannot regulate them. As a result, the cryptocurrency is not limited to a specific geographic area and can be traded around the world. Hence, Bitcoin can be used to provide low-cost money transfers, especially for those looking to transfer small amounts of money internationally, such as remittance payments (Scott, 2016). These funds can often be transferred cheaper than central bank-issued currencies, because using cryptocurrencies allows for worldwide financial transfers without the need for an intermediary. In addition, the speed of money transfer is increased by eliminating middlemen. However,  the risks and risks that it brings are undeniable. It appeared that these border independent payments also have some negative aspects that need to be considered. For instance, one characteristic is that it makes it easy to transfer money from illegal activities or fund terrorist operations without the possibility of government intervention. Since this is an independent system, it is very difficult for the government to intervene. The security of this technology is one thing the authorities are suffering from. Furthermore, no government or central bank can influence the supply of cryptocurrencies, as the supply is determined by the underlying protocol of the
cryptocurrency. Consequently, no state can influence the cash flow, which limits the power of government. Due to the loss of government power and the threat of terrorism funding, some countries have banned the use of cryptocurrencies, for example Indonesia has banned cryptocurrencies from being used in their own countries.
</p> <br>
<p> Finally, Cryptocurrencies have a positive effect on me personally. The advent of cryptocurrency and its technological value not only help the technology of the world to develop but each individual can be helped. It is possible to make money and trade those virtual currencies by buying at low value and selling at high value. Furthermore, investing in a calculated and non-obligatory way in connection with any intermediary transaction will give you the ability to legally freely execute transactions. But besides that the lack of understanding in this issue is also a danger because its transactions are easy to let you lose your guard, leading to losing money. There are many people who have been fooled. For example, Bitcoinnet two years ago the bitcoinnet opened up investment packages that only required players to invest money and interest would be returned periodically, which was extremely large 30% of their total investment and a lot of people have participated. and the result for those people is a loss of money invested after a short period of time when these investment packages are active. Since the government is unable to participate in this block chain system, the participants' subsequent filing of lawsuits is virtually meaningless. But if we look at the reality of transparent technologies and their utility, it will be very good if their utilities are legally controlled and developed. That would be a huge step forward for trading.
</p> <br>
<p> In short, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are one of the modern technologies and it needs to be developed more explicitly in order to be legally used. More and more convenience will be promoted more and more because today's demands are changing gradually. In my way of thinking, will be a great advantage for those who learn and study more closely about cryptocurrencies and block chains can do in the future.

<h2> <font color="red"> Project Ideas: </font> </h2>
<p><mark> <b> Overview:</b> </mark> Overall, this will be a smart and automatic watering project. This project will include the installation of a sprinkler system and temperature sensor system for each area separately. Moreover, this is not only a simple automatic watering project but also includes an analysis of the plant's condition and its growth environment. It will help optimize plant growth and achieve the same results on a large scale. Because of that, such benefits save labor, time and quantity of production will be significantly increased. This will be a technology suitable for Vietnam's environment, it will help farmers and industry of Vietnam to achieve success in the future.
</p>
<p> <mark> <b> Description:</b> </mark> A smart and automatic watering project will have 2 main steps which are to set irrigation and ambient sensor systems. Firstly, the irrigation system will be distributed correctly in each area so that when watering will ensure the amount of water to water the plants in an equal amount. For instance, the installation of an automatic irrigation system for orange trees will be the position between the 4 trees, it will help when watering those 4 orange trees will have an equal amount of water and at the same time of day. Moreover, even if a farm is guaranteed that every tree will have the same watering regime, the quality of the oranges will always be the same and guaranteed. Besides orange trees, all such agricultural produce as vegetables, potatoes and even ornamental plants will have similar results.
</p>
<p> Secondly, ambient sensor systems will also be installed based on application calculations. This system will be placed high above and around the habitat of these trees and all other surrounding areas. Moreover, their task will be to collect information about temperature, light, humidity and wind to give information about the center of the application. Accordingly, according to the data that the application has collected, the programmed system will analyze the status of the trees in each area, which will result in how to provide suitable and timely solutions for trees. On the other hand, after receiving information and analysis from ambient sensor systems, there will be a programmed program for the watering system to adjust the amount of water accordingly (this amount of water will include fertilizer dissolve in water to come). For instance, on dry days, ambient sensor systems will notify the system's main center that the orange tree area is in need of water and this dry environment will directly affect the tree. Based on the analytical information, the irrigation system will be adjusted to irrigate with more water and appropriate fertilizer to help stabilize the orange trees.
</p>
<p> Finally, once the system is complete, its owners can directly view the status of the plants through analysis and reports of ambient sensor systems. Moreover, the user will not need to go directly to the planting area to control the device because the system will be integrated on the system's computer and will grow to be compatible with the phone if the user is not directly located at the computer-controlled position. For example, when the system owner does not need to go to the location of each tree in hot weather but instead in the control area to check everything on the data. In addition, when they have a job they cannot stay on the farm and have to go to another city, they can still connect to the device by phone to control and check the situation of the tree. In short, an intelligent and automatic watering project will be installed with all the information based on the most accurate experts to ensure that there will be no errors in interpreting and adjusting the water volume for suitable.
